# Mapping Global Data Sets 

## JSON Format

In this section, we will be:
- Using data that represents all the earthquakes that have occured in the world during the previous month.
- Make a map showing the location of these earthquakes and how significant each one was.
- As the data is stored in JSON format, we will work with it using ```json``` module.
- We will also use ```Plotly``` as a mapping tool in order to create visualizations that clearly show the global distribution earthquakes.


### Steps:

Run ```python eq_world_map.py ``` or ```python3 eq_world_map.py ```.

## Resources
